ðŸ”° Issues
		
(i) We have just one issue in our project that is string
operation. Because of that the project is in C programming
Which is not contains high-level string operations, so thats 
why we face some issues about that.
		
*User Recommended String Operation be like :-
	
HI_This_is_a_string! (Right Method)
*Invalid Operation :-

HI this is a string ! (wrong Method)

*NOTE : If you decleared a String with wrong method the system
Will show you segmentation fault or Some System Error !

	
ðŸ”° OS support

Besically this project can supports on every OS platform
But most of the peoples are use Windows and linux, So i
made a script for both(windows & Linux) platform for auto-matically 
run the project or Software.

*Windows :
In Windows folder a script you find which is 
Salespoint.bat which is auto-matically run the
Software .

*NOTE : But The script needs to install GCC
